merge

Merge two files by ORing corresponding bytes from each file. Useful if you have two incomplete files of the same source file, with blocks of bytes nulled (e.g. from torrents).

    $ xxd -p file1
    0002000440
    $ xxd -p file2
    0100030002
    $ ./merge file1 file2 > merged-file
    $ xxd -p merged-file
    0102030442
